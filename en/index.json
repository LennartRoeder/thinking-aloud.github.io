I implemented projects for customers and advised them. I kept asking myself the question: Why do we always do it the same way? There’s a much more efficient way! I had a vision and a goal: my aim is to reinterpret the world of IT consulting in order to change the status quo.\nI wanted to make processes more efficient, be freer in the execution of my work, give customers an even better experience and work with people who pursue the same goals as I do.\nThis is exactly why I founded uRemoTech. A place where customers not only receive the best advice, but also find individual, practical solutions for their specific challenges. At the same time, uRemoTech offers employees the opportunity to take on responsibility, to continuously develop themselves and to harmoniously combine their professional and private lives. No more hour-long commutes, instead efficient working from home - supported by the latest technologies.\nToday, the name uRemoTech proudly stands for the 3 fundamental pillars of the company:\nu (you) stands for you: You are the center of attention! As an employee or customer for our service-oriented approach.\nRemo (Remote): Symbolizes our 100% remote approach that we not only live, but also promote. This approach enables our team members to realize a flexible combination of private life and work in today’s digital age and thus creates an innovative way of working together.\nTech (technology): Tech symbolizes innovation. It is progress not only for us, but for everything in life and we are a part of it. Our focus is on the adept use of state-of-the-art technology to achieve technological excellence. Always with the aim of taking our customers to the next evolutionary stage of digitalization.\nWith the founding of uRemoTech, the I became a we.
